## Database Models

### User
Base authentication model with email, password, and role

### Student
Extended profile with student ID, academic information, and enrollment data

### Professor  
Extended profile with professor ID, department, office hours, and specialization

### Course
Course information including prerequisites, schedule, and enrollment limits

### Enrollment
Many-to-many relationship between students and courses

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Access the API**:
   - Server runs on `http://localhost:9600`
   - API documentation: `http://localhost:9600/docs`
   - Alternative docs: `http://localhost:9600/redoc`

## Authentication Usage

1. **Register a user** (student or professor)
2. **Login** to get JWT token
3. **Include token** in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`
4. **Access protected endpoints** based on user role

## Database

- Uses SQLite database stored in `data/academic_management.db`
- Database is automatically created on first run
- All tables are created via SQLAlchemy models

## Security Features

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Role-based access control
- Input validation with Pydantic schemas
- SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy ORM

## Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request (validation errors)
- 401: Unauthorized (invalid credentials)
- 403: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Internal Server Error

## Testing

Use tools like:
- **Postman** or **Insomnia** for manual API testing
- **FastAPI docs** at `/docs` for interactive testing
- **curl** commands for command-line testing

Example curl command:
```bash
# Login
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9600/auth/login" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "student@example.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Search courses (with token)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9600/students/courses/search?department=Computer%20Science" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>"
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Change SECRET_KEY** in `config/auth.py`
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Add rate limiting**
4. **Implement proper logging**
5. **Add comprehensive test suite**
6. **Use production database** (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
7. **Add API versioning**
8. **Implement caching** for frequently accessed data
